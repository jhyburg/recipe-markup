<title>Quick and Easy Blueberry Muffins Recipe</title>
<h1>Quick and Easy Blueberry Muffins</h1>
<p><i>All you need is one bowl. This recipe is so easy when we're in the mood for something more than cerel, we'll skip pancakes and make these for breakfast instead. This blueberry muffin recipe makes 8 large, big-topped muffins, 10 standards muffins or 20 to 22 mini muffins (see note below about baking time for mini muffins). Since most standard muffin tins have 12 muffin cups, if you plan on making the larger muffins, we recommend adding 1 to 2 tabelspoons of wter to the empty cups. This way the cups with water will heat up at the same rate as the cups with muffin batter, helping the muffins cook evenly </i></p>
