<h1>Quick and Easy Blueberry Muffins</h1>
<p><i>All you need is one bowl. This recipe is so easy when we're in the mood for something more than cerel, we'll skip pancakes and make these for breakfast instead. This blueberry muffin recipe makes 8 large, big-topped muffins, 10 standards muffins or 20 to 22 mini muffins (see note below about baking time for mini muffins). Since most standard muffin tins have 12 muffin cups, if you plan on making the larger muffins, we recommend adding 1 to 2 tabelspoons of wter to the empty cups. This way the cups with water will heat up at the same rate as the cups with muffin batter, helping the muffins cook evenly </i></p>

<h3>Prepare Oven and Muffin Cups</h3>
<p>Heat oven to 400 degrees F. For big-topped muffins, line 8 standard-size muffin cups with paper liners. For standard-size muffins line 10 muffin cups. Fill the remaining cups with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to help the muffins bake evenly</p>
<h3>Make Batter</h3>

    → Add milk mixture to the bowl with dry ingredients then us a fork to combine.<b>Do not Over Mix</b> (The muffin batter will be quite thick-see note below for more details).Fold in the blueberries.
    <h3>Bake Muffins</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    →Divide the batter between muffin cups.(if making big-topped muffins, the batter will come to the tops of the paper liners). Sprinkle a little sugar on top of each muffin
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <span>&#8594;</h4> Bake muffins 15 to 20 minutes or until tops are no longer wet and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out with crumbs, not wet batter. Transfer to a cooling rack.
      <h4> Step 3</h4>
